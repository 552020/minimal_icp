# `most_minimal_script_app`

Welcome to your new `most_minimal_script_app` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `most_minimal_script_app`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd most_minimal_script_app/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Issues

Absolutely. Here's a list of the problems you encountered and solved step-by-step to get your standalone TypeScript script talking to an IC canister:

---

### ✅ **Problems Solved in Setting Up a Standalone Script for ICP**

#### **1. Understanding ICP Identities**

- Clarified that an **identity** is a **cryptographic keypair**.
- Understood that identities are used to generate **Principals** and authenticate requests to canisters.
- Realized you can **manually create identities** (e.g., Alice and Bob) without using Internet Identity (II).

---

#### **2. Project Structure & Dependencies**

- Originally placed `package.json` in the `scripts/` folder.
- Moved `package.json` to the **project root** so that shared declarations and dependencies would resolve correctly.
- Ensured required dependencies:

  - `@dfinity/agent`
  - `@dfinity/identity`
  - `ts-node` / `tsx`
  - TypeScript

---

#### **3. Declaration Resolution**

- Generated TypeScript declarations into `src/declarations` via `dfx generate`.
- Needed to ensure scripts could **import those declarations** correctly.
- Clarified that **declarations can be relocated** if needed and configured in `dfx.json`.

---

#### **4. Canister ID Importing**

- Learned that `createActor` requires an explicit **canister ID**.
- Determined canister ID should be dynamically imported from:

  ```ts
  import canisterIds from "../.dfx/local/canister_ids.json" assert { type: "json" };
  ```

- Resolved issue where the script failed due to undefined or outdated canister ID.

---

#### **5. Canister Deployment Sync**

- Realized the error `canister_not_found` came from calling a canister ID not currently deployed.
- Ran `dfx deploy` again to **redeploy and sync** local `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.

---

#### **6. Replica Connectivity**

- Verified that the local replica was **healthy** via `dfx ping`.
- Used `agent.fetchRootKey()` to ensure the script trusts the local replica’s root key.

---

#### **7. Script Path Error**

- Initially tried to run the script from the wrong path:

  ```bash
  npx tsx script1.ts  # ❌ outside scripts folder
  ```

- Fixed by running:

  ```bash
  npx tsx scripts/script1.ts  # ✅ or from within scripts/
  ```

---

#### **8. Deprecated Method Warning**

- Got a notice that `createActor` uses some deprecated methods internally, but this didn’t block execution.
- Aware you might want to **watch for breaking changes** in future SDK versions.

---

You now have a working standalone TypeScript script that talks to a local IC canister, with an understanding of identities, deployment, and structure. Next steps might include persisting identities, scripting messages between users, or testing on the IC mainnet.

Let me know if you want this exported into an `.md` summary or further cleaned up.
