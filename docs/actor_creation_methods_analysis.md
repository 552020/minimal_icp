# Actor Creation Methods Analysis (with Integrated Considerations)

## Issue: Two Different Approaches for Creating IC Actors in TypeScript Scripts

### Overview

When creating TypeScript scripts to interact with Internet Computer (IC) canisters, there are two distinct approaches for creating actors that communicate with canisters. Both methods use the same Candid interface definitions (IDL factories), but differ in how they instantiate the actor. This document analyzes both actor creation patterns, their pros/cons, and alignment with DFX tooling and SDK architecture.

---

## Method 1: Manual Actor Creation with IDL Factory

### Code Pattern

```typescript
import { idlFactory } from "../src/declarations/share_tpk_backend";
import canisterIds from "../.dfx/local/canister_ids.json" assert { type: "json" };

const canisterId = canisterIds["share_tpk_backend"].local;
const agent = await HttpAgent.create({ identity, host });

const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  canisterId,
});
```

### Pros

- **Explicit Control**: Full control over how the agent and actor are created.
- **Transparent**: Direct use of `idlFactory` and agent, which is good for learning and debugging.
- **Flexible**: You can inject a custom agent, identity, HTTP headers, or override actor behavior.
- **Educational**: Helps developers understand how the IC SDK works under the hood.
- **Consistent**: Aligns with low-level SDK usage across Node.js or custom setups.
- **Debugging**: Lets you pinpoint issues in actor or agent setup more easily.

### Cons

- **More Code**: More boilerplate, more setup to manage manually.
- **Manual Management**: Need to load canister ID and manage identity persistence explicitly.
- **Error-Prone**: Extra complexity increases risk of typos and mismatches.
- **Type Assertions**: If not paired with proper type imports (`_SERVICE`), type safety can degrade.

## Method 2: Generated Actor Factory Function (DFX `createActor`)

### Code Pattern

```typescript
import { createActor } from "../src/declarations/encrypted_files_backend";

const CANISTER_ID = getCanisterId("encrypted_files_backend", "local");
const agent = await HttpAgent.create({ identity, host });

const actor = createActor(CANISTER_ID, { agentOptions: { host } });
```

### Pros

- **Simpler**: Minimal code to get started.
- **Convenient**: Built by DFX to abstract common patterns.
- **Type Safety**: The `ActorSubclass<_SERVICE>` type is tied directly to your `.did` file.
- **Standard**: Matches DFX documentation and frontend app templates.
- **Less Error-Prone**: Less manual logic = fewer bugs.

### Cons

- **Less Explicit**: Internals (e.g. use of `idlFactory`) are hidden.
- **Less Control**: Cannot fully customize the actor or inject advanced agent logic unless you replace internals.
- **Black Box**: If something goes wrong, it’s harder to debug.
- **Tightly Coupled**: Assumes DFX project layout and code generation conventions.

## Documentation Verification

The current [DFX documentation (v0.26.1)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally) recommends **Method 2** (`createActor`). DFX-generated declarations are placed in `src/declarations/`, and include:

```ts
export declare const idlFactory: IDL.InterfaceFactory;
export declare const canisterId: string;
export declare const createActor: (canisterId: string, options?: CreateActorOptions) => ActorSubclass<_SERVICE>;
```

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### What Is an IDL Factory?

An **IDL factory** is a function that returns the Candid interface for a canister in JavaScript, using the `IDL` types from `@dfinity/candid`. DFX automatically generates one from your `.did` file. It’s needed to tell the SDK how to encode and decode method calls.

```ts
export const idlFactory: IDL.InterfaceFactory = ({ IDL }) => {
  return IDL.Service({
    greet: IDL.Func([IDL.Text], [IDL.Text], []),
  });
};
```

This is passed into `Actor.createActor()` to produce a working client interface.

---

### Internals

- **Method 1**:
  - You provide all components (IDL, agent, canisterId).
  - `Actor.createActor()` uses the IDL factory to produce a dynamic proxy.

- **Method 2**:
  - `createActor()` is a DFX-generated wrapper that internally calls `Actor.createActor(idlFactory, ...)`.
  - It creates the agent for you (if you don’t pass one), fetches the root key (in local), and returns the actor.

## Performance Comparison

|                      | Method 1             | Method 2                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Bundle Size**      | Smaller (no wrapper) | Slightly larger (includes factory logic) |
| **Runtime Overhead** | Minimal              | Negligible                               |
| **Memory Use**       | Equivalent           | Equivalent                               |

There is **no real performance difference** at runtime that would impact your decision.

## Use Case Recommendations

| Use Case                    | Recommended Method       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Quick scripts / frontends   | Method 2 (`createActor`) |
| Custom agent/identity setup | Method 1 (manual)        |
| Library/SDK development     | Method 1                 |
| Educational/demo code       | Method 1                 |
| Production DFX apps         | Method 2                 |

## Best Practice Summary

### Start With:

> **Method 2 (createActor)**
> Simple, safe, and aligns with DFX defaults.

### Switch To:

> **Method 1 (manual)**
> Only when you need more control — for debugging, custom agents, or library code.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Method 2 by default** in any project or script unless:

- You hit a limitation.
- You want to control actor creation deeply.
- You’re writing reusable modules that shouldn’t depend on DFX-generated output.

This layered approach is the **most practical and maintainable strategy**:

> **Use `createActor()` until you have the necessity to switch to `Actor.createActor()` — not before.**

---

## TL;DR

- **Method 2 (`createActor`)** is best for simplicity, production code, and frontend development.
- **Method 1 (`Actor.createActor`)** is best for control, libraries, and debugging.

Knowing **both methods** allows you to start fast, then scale when needed — with confidence.
